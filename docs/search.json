    "text": "For one reason or another, the statistics gods have blessed us with data of all of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama’s entire tweet history during Obama’s presidency. In this project we will explore the results of wrangling this data and utilizing it to create tons of interesting statistics, plots and graphs.\n\nNumber of significant words tweeted per month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur story begins with simply counting how many significant words were tweeted by across each recorded month for a Barack-exclusive dataset, a Michelle-exclusive dataset, and a combined dataset. It’s important to note that the term “significant words” can be defined as words that are not stopwords (ie: the, to, and, etc.), and words that are within dlpyr’s word list package. This was done the because there were lots of stopwords and online links that were parsed into words during the data wrangling process that needed to be filtered out. Therefore, the words recorded in lots of the dataset are a very limited (but relevant) subset of the complete Twitter history of our former executive leaders.\nWe can see that there is a large variability within how much was tweeted by month for both Barack and Michelle, especially during 2015 which may call to the variety of everchanging issues and matter of which it is important to post about during each month. Both people also seemed to tweet much less during the following year at their own respective rate, which could potentially indicate a more relaxed, habitual usage of twitter as they get used to this new platform of media.\n\n\nMost common words by month\n\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n# Groups:   year, month [19]\n   year  month word        n\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1 2015  05    change      4\n 2 2015  06    health      5\n 3 2015  07    people      8\n 4 2015  08    deal        4\n 5 2015  09    cut         3\n 6 2015  10    today       3\n 7 2015  11    america     3\n 8 2015  12    strong      2\n 9 2016  01    great       4\n10 2016  02    house       2\n11 2016  03    apply       3\n12 2016  04    today       3\n13 2016  05    day         2\n14 2016  06    court       3\n15 2016  07    day         2\n16 2016  08    world       4\n17 2016  09    history     2\n18 2016  10    today       3\n19 2016  11    today       3\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n# Groups:   year, month [19]\n   year  month word        n\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1 2015  05    lady       20\n 2 2015  06    lady       76\n 3 2015  07    lady       42\n 4 2015  08    check       3\n 5 2015  09    school     92\n 6 2015  10    lady       39\n 7 2015  11    lady       60\n 8 2015  12    lady        8\n 9 2016  01    lady        9\n10 2016  02    lady       28\n11 2016  03    lady       67\n12 2016  04    lady       50\n13 2016  05    lady       47\n14 2016  06    lady       29\n15 2016  07    lady       10\n16 2016  08    america     4\n17 2016  09    lady       28\n18 2016  10    lady       34\n19 2016  11    achieve     1\n\n\nNext, we see the most common words by month recorded for both Barack and Michelle (since the majority of tweets during this time period come from Michelle, the combined dataset isn’t used here). The words most commonly used by Barack emit a sense of political activism, initiative and inspiration–including great, change, health, people, history, etc.. On the other hand, almost of all of Michelle’s most commonly used words by month were “lady” (possibly in self-reference to her title as first lady)–not that exciting at all.\n\n\nMost common word pairs\n\n\n# A tibble: 971 × 3\n   word1      word2         n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1 climate    change       11\n 2 white      house        10\n 3 health     care          7\n 4 gun        violence      6\n 5 affordable health        5\n 6 million    americans     5\n 7 supreme    court         5\n 8 health     coverage      4\n 9 paris      agreement     4\n10 2          yrs           3\n# ℹ 961 more rows\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 10,049 × 3\n   word1      word2         n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1 michelle   obama        83\n 2 kitchen    garden       78\n 3 military   families     66\n 4 girls      education    64\n 5 white      house        63\n 6 whitehouse kitchen      63\n 7 president  obama        60\n 8 watch      live         50\n 9 lady       michelle     44\n10 flotus     amp          43\n# ℹ 10,039 more rows\n\n\nAfter analyzing all of the most common individual words, I deemed it appropriate to take this data analysis to the next level and identify the most common pairs of words used by both Barack and Michelle in their tweets. Because there are so few examples to sample from, we will be counting from the total collection of pair words rather than sorting it by month. The politically relevant theme of Barack’s tweets carries over into a more complete demonstration when analyzing these bigrams, with examples revealed such as “climate change”, “health care”, “gun violence”, and “paris agreement”. With Michelle, our theory of self-referencing is somewhat justified by her most common bigram being “michelle obama”. Aditionally, an activism towards more auxiliary political issues is revealed through this list by entries such as “military families” and “girls education”.\n\n\nProportion of retweets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the different tweeting habits between Michelle and Barack could potentially be explained by how often either one of them send out a retweet versus sending out an original tweet. By detecting which of each person’s tweets start with the letters “RT” we can identify if any given particular tweet was a retweet or not, with our resulting bar graph showing a significant difference in proportion of retweets between Barack and Michelle.\n\n\nSentiments of tweets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the remaining two charts, we will solely be focusing on Barack’s tweeting history to see if we can garner any further insights about his final 20 months as president. First we will be looking at a measure of “net proportional positivity” for each of our recorded months by appending either a positive and negative sentiment to a select subset of our words. We then add together the net sum of each sentiment (assuming that a positive word has a +1 value and a negative word has a -1 value) and dividing that number by the total number of words utilized in the calculation. What we find is an oddly positive sentiment from Baracks tweets across every single month with no net proportional sentiment dipping under 0.5 and many of them sitting at a proportion of 1.0. This could support the driven and fearless character that President Obama seems to have built his campaign off of as shown by his word choice in our previous charts.\n\n\nMood words of tweets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we analyze a plethora of different moods of words by appending a much broader list of emotions to our list of words. We derive the same process from our previous chart by taking the proportion of each emotion used in the words of Barack’s tweets and dividing it by the total amount of words tweeted within that month. The results show a surprisingly unwavering proportion of each emotion for each month, regardless of how many total words were tweeted out during that month, which could possibly allude to an unwavering character not easily influenced by outside events or conflicts."

Because of the stark contrast in gas prices from the west coast to the rest of the country, an artificial scale had to be produced to accentuate the smaller differences between the states in the midwest and east coast. We can see that the cheapest gas prices tend to be in the Deep South and slowly start to increase as we fan out to the surrounding regions, with a drastic increase once you approach the west coast, even with our readjusted scale."

We can see by the graph that in the more central, rural parts of the US, full-size trucks, (such as the Chevy Silverado, Ford F-Series and GMC Sierra), seem to be the vastly dominant choice for peoples. This would make sense given the more agriculturally focused work within those climates paired with a more off-road-dependent driving environment. In the more urban, coastal regions of the US, compact crossovers appear to be the craze with examples such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Tesla Model Y consistently being the most popular choice in those areas. This is most likely explained by the more centralized environment these drivers most likely live in, where there is little to no need to go off the beaten path."
